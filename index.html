<h2>When the Muslims conquered Makkah. The Prophet (ﷺ) said,“Allah had</h2>
<h2>made this city sacred the day He created the heavens and the earth and</h2>
<h2>it’s sanctity shall remain until the Day of Qiyamah (Day of Judgement).</h2>
<h2>Its thorns cannot be broken, its animals cannot be harmed and things</h2>
<h2>fallen on its ground cannot be picked up unless with the intention of</h2>
<h2>returning it to its owner or making public announcements (to locate the</h2>
<h2>owner). It is also forbidden to cut the grass that (naturally) grows here.”</h2>
